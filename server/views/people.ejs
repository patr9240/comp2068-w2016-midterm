     <h3>Daenerys Targaryen</h3>
   <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/daenerys.jpg" />
   <p>Daenerys is the only daughter of Aerys II Targaryen and Rhaella Targaryen.

She is now a princess living in exile, the last of the Targaryens.

Daenerys was born in the closing days of Robert's Rebellion after her father, "the mad king" had already been killed. Rhaella and her son Viserys, were evacuated to Dragonstone shortly before Aerys's death, where Rhaella gave birth to Daenerys in the midst of a violent storm that destroyed the remnants of the Targaryen fleet, leading to her moniker, Daenerys Stormborn. Her mother died giving birth.

Daenerys and Viserys were saved from capture by Ser Willem Darry and four other loyal men who were able to spirit them away to Braavos. Ser Willem looked after the children until he died several years later, and they were forced out into the streets. They wandered from city to city, ending up in Pentos, where Illyrio Mopatis took them in.

Although timid and unsure of herself at first Daenerys grows into a supremely confident warrior women with perhaps the most stringent code of ethics in all the Seven Kingdoms.

She believes she is the rightful heir to the Iron Throne and is on a mission to reclaim it. </p>
